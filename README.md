## Why Solana Agent

### Batteries Included
* Based on CyberChipped - a Python OpenAI Assistant Framework
* Provides conversational memory, parallel function calling, smart automatic tool choice, and message history using MongoDB
* Utilizes FastAPI and Next.js - the most popular and supported web frameworks 
* Quickly add custom functions to your AI agent in a few lines of code
* Solana Agent Actions: 
    * Transfer tokens from the Agent wallet to other wallets - via Helius
    * Swap tokens inside the Agent wallet - via Jupiter and Helius
* Social Integrations: 
    * X - via the X API (Basic Plan)

### Better than Eliza
* Solana Agent requires no-code changes, only adding simple environment variables, and MongoDB/Redis to work out of the box for a complete AI Agent with real-time chat
* Solana Agent's conversational history is superior to RAG for user interactivity, tool usage, and agent memory/recall/context
* Solana Agent's parallel tool calling and automatic AI tool choice is superior than using any LLM completion API with tool usage from any provider
* Solana Agent is an opinionated framework with one way to do things to keep things simple
* Solana Agent is written in Python the most popular language on GitHub and in the AI field
* Solana Agent replies on X in real-time and only replies when it should

## Local Dev

###  Run locally on Mac or Linux
* Clone this repo - `git clone https://github.com/truemagic-coder/solana-agent`
* Ensure the latest LTS Node is installed with yarn
* Ensure Python 3.12.7 is installed with poetry
* Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed
* `docker-compose up -d`
* Rename `.env.sample` to `.env` in `site` and `agent`
* Get and set the PRIVATE_KEY (in base58 string format) in the `site` folder for `.env` file - if you want Solana Actions like sending tokens and swapping with funds from this wallet
* Get and set the OPENAI_API_KEY var in the `agent` folder for `.env` file - [OpenAI API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
* Get and set the HELIUS_API_KEY and HELIUS_RPC_URL in both folders `.env` files - [Helius](https://helius.dev)
* If you want XBot - then setup a X developer account and setup the keys in `agent` folder for `.env` file - and uncomment the code in `main.py`
* Set all the secrets to match between the `.env` files and make them `uuidv4`s or other strong keys
* Open two terminal windows
* `Terminal 1`: `cd site && yarn install && yarn dev`
* `Terminal 2`: `cd agent && poetry install && bash ./dev.sh`
* Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`

## Deploy

### Deploy to Heroku or Dokku
* Provision a MongoDB and Redis database
* Get one domains with two sub-domains - one for the `site` and one for the `agent`
* Add the proper env vars on Heroku or Dokku to your apps
* Add your proper remotes in each folder locally (each folder `site` and `agent` should be their own repos - `git init`)
* For each folder (`site` and `agent`) git commit and git push to the main branch
* Make sure to ps:scale `worker` and `scheduler` to 1 (web should already be 1)

## Advanced Topics

### Agent Functions
* Use expressive snake-case names for the functions with expressive param names (if required)
* Functions only take `str` params and must output a `str` (string)
* Functions must be fully sync - you cannot use async libraries or methods - example: using `requests` not `httpx` (sync vs async)
* Don't make tool outputs (strings) too large as when calling multiple calls in parallel has a size limit (combined)
* Keep in mind the 128k model token input limit when processing data especially from APIs
* OpenAI `gpt-4o` is recommended over `gpt-4o-mini` simply for AI IQ but if cost is a concern then mini may work for your agent usage
